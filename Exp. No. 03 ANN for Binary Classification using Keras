Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual path to your dataset CSV file and 
'target_column' with the name of the column containing the target variable for binary classification. 
Adjust the model architecture, such as the number of layers and neurons, as needed for your specific problem.
  
# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Step 2: Load and preprocess the dataset
# Assuming you have a dataset stored in a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = data['target_column']

# Perform any additional preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, encoding)

# Step 3: Build the neural network model using Keras
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(128, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Step 4: Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 5: Train the model on the training data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

# Step 6: Evaluate the model on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict_classes(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n{conf_matrix}')

# Step 7: Analyze the performance metrics and adjust the model if necessary
# Analyze other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
# Adjust model architecture, hyperparameters, or preprocessing steps based on performance
